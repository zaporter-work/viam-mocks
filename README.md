# Viam-Mocks
Viam module that contains personal mocks of some of Viam's components. 

This is mostly for SDK, UI, and testing interaction with components. Not for developing robots with these components. 

*This is very different from the rdk:builtin:fake components.* Those components attempt to act as stand-ins for real components that can work together as a whole unit and that allow other parts of your robot to mostly work.

The mock components in this module are not guaranteed to work well with components outside this module (or even with other mocks within this module).
